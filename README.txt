== Description ==
Queerify your website by setting a fabulous loading screen that features a choosen flag from the LGBTIQ+ spectrum - representing your own gender identity. If you're a cat lover, you'll be glad to hear that neon cat also makes an appearance.

Key Features:
* Basic options: Possibility to select a flag representing your non-heterosexual gender identity, that will be featured on the loading screen of your website. Choosen flag is revealed as the percentage of your website loading increases.
* Advanced options: COMMING SOON - it will give you possibility to further queerify your website in combination with my upcomming wordpress.org theme 'Queer'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't find a flag that represents my non-heterosexual gender identity. What should I do? =

Contact me by any means provided - either through my personal website, or through plugin's wordpress.org support page. If you can point me to the flag that is missing, it can be included in the later releases.
 
= What if I'm using a lazy-load plugin for images on my website, does it effect the selected loading screen flag and neon cat image? =

Yes, it does have an effect - flag and neon cat images are loaded with additional delay, which makes it visible only in the last half a second or so.
My recommendation is to find a plugin that enables you to choose which css class to exclude from the effect of lazy-load (use the class 'queerify-flag' and 'queerify-neon-cat').
I personally use the plugin 'Smush' by WPMU DEV for lazy-loading of images. It's a free plugin, and provides other image optimization options as well.
